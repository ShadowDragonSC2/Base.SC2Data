name: sc2-units-reference
description: StarCraft II unit catalog reference — editor IDs, races, attributes, and roles for all multiplayer units and structures across Wings of Liberty, Heart of the Swarm, and Legacy of the Void. Also covers campaign-only units and all 18 co-op commanders with their race, hero unit IDs, and signature units. Use when you need to know the correct catalog/Galaxy type ID for a unit (e.g. "SiegeTank", "HighTemplar", "BroodLord"), or when checking a unit's race, classification, expansion of origin, or which commander a unit belongs to. Referenced by sc2data-units-abilities, galaxy-units-and-groups, sc2data-actors-visuals, and sc2data-effects-weapons.

# SC2 Units Reference

This file lists all StarCraft II multiplayer units and structures with their **editor catalog IDs** — the exact strings used in both Galaxy scripting (e.g. `UnitCreate(1, "Marine", ...)`) and XML data (e.g. `<CUnit id="Marine"/>`).

> **Source of truth:** [ShadowDragon Base.SC2Data — UnitData.xml](https://github.com/ShadowDragonSC2/Base.SC2Data/blob/main/GameData/UnitData.xml). When in doubt, verify the exact ID there.

> **Expansion key:** WoL = Wings of Liberty, HotS = Heart of the Swarm, LotV = Legacy of the Void

> **Build slot mapping:** When modifying worker build times via `CAbilBuild` (`TerranBuild`, `ProtossBuild`, `ZergBuild`), the InfoArray slots are numeric (`Build1`, `Build2`, ...) — NOT the structure catalog IDs. See `sc2data-units-abilities` skill for the full verified slot-to-building mapping and standard build times for all three races.

> **Cost override pitfall — uprooted/burrowed variants:** Spine Crawler and Spore Crawler have separate uprooted CUnit entries (`SpineCrawlerUprooted`, `SporeCrawlerUprooted`). Most burrowed Zerg units also have a distinct CUnit catalog entry. If the variant's inherited cost is higher than the override on the primary unit, SC2 will charge the difference when transitioning. Always override both. If the variant catalog ID is not known, confirm it with the user before writing the override. See `sc2data-units-abilities` skill for the full pitfall table.

## Campaign & Co-op Units

These units exist in the editor's data (available as parents or `UnitCreate` targets) but are not present in standard multiplayer. Many originate from the singleplayer campaigns or co-op commanders. Editor IDs are best-effort — always verify against [ShadowDragon Base.SC2Data](https://github.com/ShadowDragonSC2/Base.SC2Data/blob/main/GameData/UnitData.xml) for the exact catalog ID.

> **Campaign key:** WoL = Wings of Liberty, HotS = Heart of the Swarm, LotV = Legacy of the Void, NCO = Nova Covert Ops (co-op), Co-op = Co-op Missions commander unit

## Working with Unit IDs

### In Galaxy script

```galaxy
// Unit type ID is always the exact catalog ID string
unit lv_marine = UnitCreate(1, "Marine", c_unitCreateIgnorePlacement, 1, lv_point, 270.0);
bool lv_isZealot = (UnitGetType(lv_unit) == "Zealot");

// Siege tank has two IDs — check both for unsieged + sieged  
bool lv_isTank = (UnitGetType(lv_unit) == "SiegeTank") || (UnitGetType(lv_unit) == "SiegeTankSieged");
```

### In XML data

```xml
<!-- The id attribute must match the catalog entry exactly -->
<CUnit id="MyCustomUnit" parent="Marine">
    ...
</CUnit>

<!-- Referencing a Blizzard-defined unit as parent -->
<CUnit id="StrongerZergling" parent="Zergling">
    <LifeMax value="75"/>
</CUnit>
```

### Transform/morph ID pairs

Some units have two IDs for their two modes — always handle both:

| Unit | Normal ID | Alternate ID |
|---|---|---|
| Siege Tank | `SiegeTank` | `SiegeTankSieged` |
| Viking | `Viking` | `VikingAssault` |
| Hellion | `Hellion` | `Hellbat` |
| Warp Prism | `WarpPrism` | `WarpPrismPhasing` |
| Gateway | `Gateway` | `WarpGate` |
| Widow Mine | `WidowMine` | `WidowMineBurrowed` |
| Lurker | `Lurker` | `LurkerBurrowed` |
| Swarm Host | `SwarmHost` | `SwarmHostBurrowed` |
| Disruptor | `Disruptor` | `DisruptorPhased` |
| Supply Depot | `SupplyDepot` | `SupplyDepotLowered` |
